Carbon price modeller and researher 

## About Me

I am a carbon price modeller and researcher with experience in equity long and long/short strategies focused on Energy Transition, Ecosystem Restoration, EARTH, and Emerging Climate Solutions. My responsibilities have included staying abreast of and implementing responses to regulatory changes, raising the awareness profile of products, conducting thematic investment research, liaising with rating agencies and distributors, managing client relations, conducting ESG, Environmental & Impact analysis, leading social media and marketing efforts, presenting product range and public speaking, engaging on sustainability matters with investee companies, and onboarding investment mandates and new products.

## Education 🎓

I have always been passionate about the environment and the impact that businesses have on the planet. This is what led me to pursue a BSc in Environmental Sciences & Biosciences from the University of Exeter, which I graduated with First Class Honours. During my studies, I developed a deep understanding of the science behind environmental issues, and I also learned about the role of businesses in driving positive change.

After completing my undergraduate studies, I wanted to gain a more in-depth understanding of the business side of sustainability, which is why I pursued an MSc in Sustainability & Business Management at the University of Bath. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on a consultancy track with Unilever in the third semester. This experience helped me develop skills in sustainable business strategy, environmental governance, and quantitative research methods, which have been invaluable in my current role as an Investment Specialist and Environmental Analyst.
